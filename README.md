## Roadkill Analysis: Species, Location and Seasonal Trends

## Key File
The most important file in this repository is [`MTHM601 Report.Rmd`](MTHM601 Report.Rmd), which contains the analysis for the project.

## Summary
This repository contains the R scripts, report and datasets for MTHM601 - Fundamentals of Data Science Report. My project analysing roadkill data. The report looks at trends in species counts, distribution and seasonal variations in roadkill.
