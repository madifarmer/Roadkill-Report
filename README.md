## Roadkill Analysis: Species, Location and Seasonal Trends

## Key File
The most important file in this repository is [MTHM601 Report.Rmd](MTHM601 Report.Rmd), which contains the analysis for the project.

## Summary
This repository contains the R scripts, report and datasets for MTHM601 - Fundamentals of Data Science Report. My project analysing roadkill data. The report looks at trends in spatial distribution, weather impacts and seasonal variations in roadkill. 

## Objectives
The goal of this report is to:
1. Identify seasonal trends in mammalian roadkill
2. Find roadkill hotspots across UK regions
3. Assess the role of temperature and rainfall on roadkill prevalence

## Dataset
- Roadkill data: [The Road Lab](https://www.theroadlab.co.uk/)
- Weather data: [The Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/uk-and-regional-series)


## Key R Tools Used
- Data Wrangling: tidyverse, dplyr
- Analysis: MASS
- Visualisation: ggplot2, tmap,  flextable


## Results
## Key Findings:
- Roadkill counts are significantly lower in Winter, and are relatively stable in Spring, Summer and Autumn.
- Temperature leads to an increase in roadkill counts, whereas rainfall decreases them.
- Norfolk has the highest roadkill counts, while Inner London - West has the lowest.
