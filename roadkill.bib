	abstract = {Wildlife-vehicle collisions are one of the main causes of mortality for wild mammals and birds in the UK. Here, using a dataset of 54,000+ records collated by a citizen science roadkill recording scheme between 2014–2019, we analyse and present temporal patterns of wildlife roadkill of the 19 most commonly reported taxa in the UK (84\% of all reported roadkill). Most taxa (13 out of 19) showed significant and consistent seasonal variations in road mortality and fitted one of two seasonal patterns; bimodal or unimodal: only three species (red fox Vulpes vulpes, European polecat Mustela putorius and Reeves’ muntjac deer Muntiacus reevesi) showed no significant seasonality. Species that increase movement in spring and autumn potentially have bimodal patterns in roadkill due to the increase in mate-searching and juvenile dispersal during these respective time periods (e.g. European badger Meles meles). Unimodal patterns likely represent increased mortality due to a single short pulse in activity associated with breeding (e.g. birds) or foraging (e.g. grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis in autumn). Importantly, these patterns also indicate periods of increased risk for drivers, potentially posing a greater threat to human welfare. In addition to behaviour-driven annual patterns, abiotic factors (temperature and rainfall) explained some variance in roadkill. Notably, high rainfall was associated with decreased observations of two bird taxa (gulls and Eurasian magpies Pica pica) and European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus. By quantifying seasonal patterns in roadkill, we highlight a significant anthropogenic impact on wild species, which is important in relation to conservation, animal welfare, and human safety.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Roads impact wildlife through a range of mechanisms from habitat loss and decreased landscape connectivity to direct mortality through wildlife-vehicle collisions (roadkill). These collisions have been rated amongst the highest modern risks to wildlife. With the development of “citizen science” projects, in which members of the public participate in data collection, it is now possible to monitor the impacts of roads over scales far beyond the limit of traditional studies. However, the reliability of data provided by citizen scientists for roadkill studies remains largely untested. This study used a dataset of 2,666 roadkill reports on national and regional roads in South Africa (total length {\textasciitilde}170,000 km) over 3 years. We first compared roadkill data collected from trained road patrols operating on a major highway with data submitted by citizen scientists on the same road section (431 km). We found that despite minor differences, the broad spatial and taxonomic patterns were similar between trained reporters and untrained citizen scientists. We then compared data provided by two groups of citizen scientists across South Africa: (1) those working in the zoology/conservation sector (that we have termed “regular observers,” whose reports were considered to be more accurate due to their knowledge and experience), and (2) occasional observers, whose reports required verification by an expert. Again, there were few differences between the type of roadkill report provided by regular and occasional reporters; both types identified the same area (or cluster) where roadkill was reported most frequently. However, occasional observers tended to report charismatic and easily identifiable species more often than road patrols or regular observers. We conclude that citizen scientists can provide reliable data for roadkill studies when it comes to identifying general patterns and high-risk areas. Thus, citizen science has the potential to be a valuable tool for identifying potential roadkill hotspots and at-risk species across large spatial and temporal scales that are otherwise impractical and expensive when using standard data collection methodologies. This tool allows researchers to extract data and focus their efforts on potential areas and species of concern, with the ultimate goal of implementing effective roadkill-reduction measures.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Many systems employ “crowds” of volunteers to collect these data at large spatial extents (e.g., US state or small country scale), especially along roadways. This raises the important question of how these systems could be standardized and the data made broadly useful in ecological and transportation studies, i.e., beyond the system area or goals. We describe two of the first and longest-running systems for volunteer observation of road-associated wildlife (live and dead) at the US state scale. The California Roadkill Observation System (CROS, {\textless}ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wildlifecrossing.net/california" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"{\textgreater}http://wildlifecrossing.net/california{\textless}/ext-link{\textgreater}) uses a form-based data entry system to report carcasses resulting from wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC). Operating since 2009, it currently (June, 2017) contains 1,338 users and \&gt;54,000 observations of 424 species of ground-dwelling vertebrates and birds, making it one of the most successful examples of crowd-sourced, roadkill and wildlife reporting. Its sister system, the Maine Audubon Wildlife Road Watch ({\textless}ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wildlifecrossing.net/maine" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"{\textgreater}http://wildlifecrossing.net/maine{\textless}/ext-link{\textgreater}) has a similar structure, and can accept data from transect surveys, animal tracks and scat observations, and reports of “no animal observed.” Both systems can operate as web-applications on a smart-phone (using a web browser), providing the ability to enter observations in the field. Locational accuracy for California observations was estimated to be ±14 m ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 552 records). Species identification accuracy rate for observations with photographs was 97\% ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 3,700 records). We propose that large extent, volunteer systems can be used to monitor wildlife occurrences along or away from roads and that these observations can be used to inform ecological studies and transportation mitigation planning.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            In light of rapidly expanding road networks worldwide, there is increasing global awareness of the growing amount of mammalian roadkill. However, the ways in which road mortality affects the population dynamics of different species remains largely unclear. We aimed to categorise the demographic parameters in mammalian populations around the world that are directly or indirectly affected by road mortality, as well as identify the most effective study designs for quantifying population‐level consequences of road mortality. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review to synthesise literature published between 2000 and 2021 and out of 11,238 unique studies returned, 83 studies were retained comprising 69 mammalian species and 150 populations. A bias towards research‐intensive countries and larger mammals was apparent. Although searches were conducted in five languages, all studies meeting the inclusion criteria were in English. Relatively few studies (13.3\%) provided relevant demographic context to roadkill figures, hampering understanding of the impacts on population persistence. We categorised five direct demographic parameters affected by road mortality: sex‐ and age‐biased mortality, the percentage of a population killed on roads per year (values up to 50\% were reported), the contribution of roadkill to total mortality rates (up to 80\%), and roadkill during inter‐patch or long‐distance movements. Female‐biased mortality may be more prevalent than previously recognised and is likely to be critical to population dynamics. Roadkill was the greatest source of mortality for 28\% of studied populations and both additive and compensatory mechanisms to roadkill were found to occur, bringing varied challenges to conservation around roads. In addition, intra‐specific population differences in demographic effects of road mortality were common. This highlights that the relative importance of road mortality is likely to be context specific as the road configuration and habitat quality surrounding a population can vary. Road ecology studies that collect data on key life parameters, such as age/stage/sex‐specific survival and dispersal success, and that use a combination of methods are critical in understanding long‐term impacts. Quantifying the demographic impacts of road mortality is an important yet complex consideration for proactive road management.},

Approximately half of all UK grassland species can be found along the country's 500,000 km of roads, with some 91 species either threatened or near threatened. Careful management of these "wildlife corridors" is therefore essential to preventing species extinction and maintaining biodiversity in grassland habitats. Wildlife trusts have often enlisted the support of volunteers to survey roadside verges and identify new "Local Wildlife Sites" as areas of high conservation potential. Using volunteer survey data from 3,900 km of roadside verges alongside publicly available street-view imagery, we present DeepVerge; a deep learning-based method that can automatically survey sections of roadside verges by detecting the presence of positive indicator species. Using images and ground truth survey data from the rural county of Lincolnshire, DeepVerge achieved a mean accuracy of 88\%. Such a method may be used by local authorities to identify new local wildlife sites, and aid management and environmental planning in line with legal and government policy obligations, saving thousands of hours of manual labour.},

	abstract = {Georeferenced information on road infrastructure is essential for spatial planning, socio-economic assessments and environmental impact analyses. Yet current global road maps are typically outdated or characterized by spatial bias in coverage. In the Global Roads Inventory Project we gathered, harmonized and integrated nearly 60 geospatial datasets on road infrastructure into a global roads dataset. The resulting dataset covers 222 countries and includes over 21 million km of roads, which is two to three times the total length in the currently best available country-based global roads datasets. We then related total road length per country to country area, population density, GDP and OECD membership, resulting in a regression model with adjusted R2 of 0.90, and found that that the highest road densities are associated with densely populated and wealthier countries. Applying our regression model to future population densities and GDP estimates from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, we obtained a tentative estimate of 3.0–4.7 million km additional road length for the year 2050. Large increases in road length were projected for developing nations in some of the world’s last remaining wilderness areas, such as the Amazon, the Congo basin and New Guinea. This highlights the need for accurate spatial road datasets to underpin strategic spatial planning in order to reduce the impacts of roads in remaining pristine ecosystems.},
